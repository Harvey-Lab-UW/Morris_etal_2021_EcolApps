Data accompanying the manuscript 'Does the legacy of historical thinning treatments foster resilience to bark beetle outbreaks in subalpine forests?' by Morris, Buonanduci, Agne, Battaglia, and Harvey published in Ecological Applications.

There are three main data files made available for reproducibility purposes:
- plot_metadata.csv
- tree_scale.csv
- stand_scale.csv


The **plot_metadata.csv** file contains metadata associated with each plot. The following columns are included:
- *PlotID*:
- *Plot*:
- *Block*:
- *Treatment*:
- *TSI*:
- *Date*:
- *Aspect_deg*:
- *Slope_deg*:
- *Elevation_m*:


The **tree_scale.csv** file contains individual tree-level data necessary to run the tree-scale analyses. The following columns are included:
- *PlotID*:
- *Species*:
- *Status*:
- *DecayClass*:
- *DBH_cm*:
- *BA_m2*:
- *Height_m*:
- *MPB*:


The **stand_scale.csv** file contains aggregated plot-level data necessary to run the stand-scale analyses. The following columns are included:
