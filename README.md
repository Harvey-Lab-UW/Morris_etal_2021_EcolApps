There are three main data files made available for reproducibility purposes:
- plot_metadata.csv
- tree_scale.csv
- stand_scale.csv


### plot_metadata.csv
This file contains metadata associated with each plot. The following columns are included:
- **PlotID**: unique plot identifier in the format Plot_Treatment_TSI. 
  - *Plot* is the site (Fraser, FR), block replicate (A-D), and plot number (1-5)
  - *Treatment* is the thinning treatment receieved in 1940 (C = control, L = light, M = moderate, H = heavy, X = clearcut)
  - *TSI* is the presence of additional timber stand improvement (TSI) thinning (N = absent, Y = present)
- **Plot**: code identifying each plot with site (Fraser, FR), block replicate (A-D), and plot number (1-5).
- **Block**: code identifying the treatment replicate containing each plot, A-D.
- **Treatment**: thinning treatment received in 1940, classified by intensity: Control (no thinning), Light, Moderate, Heavy, and Clearcut thinning.
- **TSI**: presence (Y) or absence (N) of additional timber stand improvement (TSI) thinning.
- **Date**: calendar date of field data collection, in YYYYMMDD. Range 20180705 to 20180822.
