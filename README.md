Data accompanying the manuscript 'Does the legacy of historical thinning treatments foster resilience to bark beetle outbreaks in subalpine forests?' by Morris, Buonanduci, Agne, Battaglia, and Harvey published in Ecological Applications.

There are three main data files made available for reproducibility purposes:
- plot_metadata.csv
- tree_scale.csv
- stand_scale.csv


The **plot_metadata.csv** file contains metadata associated with each plot. The following columns are included:
- *PlotID*: unique plot identifier in the format LocationPlot#_Treatment_Improvement where *Location* is the sampling site (FR = Fraser), *Plot#* is the block replicate (A-D) and plot number (1-5), *Treatment* is the thinning treatment receieved in 1940 (C = control, L = light, M = moderate, H = heavy, X = clearcut), and *Improvement* is the presence of additional timber stand improvement thinning (TSI; N = no, Y = yes).
- *Plot*: 
- *Block*: replicate
- *Treatment*: thinning treatment received in 1940, classified by intensity: Control (no thinning), Light, Moderate, Heavy, and Clearcut thinning.
- *TSI*: presence (Y) or absence (N) of additional timber stand improvement (TSI) thinning.
- *Date*:
- *Aspect_deg*:
- *Slope_deg*:
- *Elevation_m*:


The **tree_scale.csv** file contains individual tree-level data necessary to run the tree-scale analyses. The following columns are included:
- *PlotID*:
- *Species*:
- *Status*:
- *DecayClass*:
- *DBH_cm*:
- *BA_m2*:
- *Height_m*:
- *MPB*:


The **stand_scale.csv** file contains aggregated plot-level data necessary to run the stand-scale analyses. The following columns are included:
